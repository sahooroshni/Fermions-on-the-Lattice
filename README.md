# Fermions-on-the-Lattice
Project for the ETHZ course "Quantum Simulations of Gauge Theories" taught by Prof. Dr. Marina Krstic Marinkovic.

Grade: 5.75/6 
The project was focused on gaining an in-depth understanding of Dynamical Fermions and algorithms for simulating them including the Hybrid Monte Carlo and R algorithm.
